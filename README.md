# ChallengesProjects

In this repository, I gather codes I wrote for solving problems, doing challenges and practice problems in varied resources I found.

I'm self-taught in programming and is in the **beginner stage** so my codes probably might not be cool. Also, I'm currently a student in IT Major.
